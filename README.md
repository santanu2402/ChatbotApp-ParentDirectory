Seamless Authentication and Personalization: Elevating User Experience in Every Interaction
Our app offers a customized user experience with tailored sign-in, sign-up, and additional information screens, complete with clear helper text and strict client-side validation. The submit button remains disabled until all input fields are correctly filled. Additionally, we've crafted an animated collage of popular movie posters, transitioning seamlessly from left to right for added visual appeal. All user information is securely stored in MongoDB, enabling global authorization via internet connectivity. Passwords are encrypted for enhanced security.We leverage Firebase Storage to upload images, storing the URLs in MongoDB and Atlas. Within our account screen, users can view their profiles, along with recently viewed movies and search history. Profile pictures are optional, with default images based on gender if users choose not to upload one. Users can easily update their genre and language preferences, as well as their profiles, from the update account screen.

Enhanced Data Management: Seamlessly Synchronizing Online and Offline Storage for Consistency
In our app, we utilize AsyncStorage from React Native for offline storage, Zustland for storage management, and Immer for seamless live changes. For instance, suppose we have a 'dark mode' variable in the store with a value of true. If it's modified in one screen, Immer ensures that not only is its value updated but also that the changes are propagated to all other screens in real-time. During the sign-in process, we initially fetch all user profile details, lists, and movie information from MongoDB Atlas online and store them in offline storage. This synchronization between online and offline storage is achieved using a technique where any additions, updates, or deletions are first made online. Once the changes are successfully applied online, we then update the offline storage. This approach ensures atomicity and consistency, maintaining data integrity across both storage mediums.

Dynamic Content Filtering: Tailoring Content Access Based on User Age for a Safer Experience
At registration, we collect the user's date of birth to calculate their age. This calculation occurs each time the user opens the app, adjusting for the present date. The user's age determines if they are an adult, enabling access to age-restricted content. This ensures our platform remains suitable for all age groups. To implement this feature, we employ a filtering logic. This logic sifts through all movie lists on every screen, removing movies that don't meet the age criteria. By doing so, we ensure that only appropriate content is displayed to users based on their age.

Engaging Onboarding Experience: Unveiling Key Features with Animated Welcome Screens
Our app features a 'Getting Started' screen, doubling as a welcoming interface, which appears only once after the initial login. This screen is adorned with Lottie animation and animated using Reanimated 3. Its purpose is to unveil our key features, acquainting users with our app's functionalities before they dive in.

Engaging Home Screen: Diverse Sections and Seamless Navigation for Rich Content Exploration
The home screen of our app boasts multiple engaging sections, including popular, trending, top-rated, upcoming, now playing, and recommended. Each section on the home screen displays results from the first page, with a 'More' button beside it. Clicking the 'More' button redirects users to a specific list screen. For instance, selecting 'More' on the upcoming section navigates users to the 'All Upcoming' screen. Pagination is implemented in these list screens, featuring a 'Load More' button at the end to fetch additional results from previous movies. Furthermore, the popular section on the homepage is designed as a carousel with a captivating parallax effect, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.

Enhanced Recommendation System: Leveraging Content-Based Filtering for Personalized Movie Suggestions
Our recommendation system relies on content-based filtering, which suggests movies based on the genres of previously viewed films. To implement this, we preprocess the dataset by converting each attribute into tags and appending them to create a comprehensive tag list. We then remove irrelevant 'stop' words, symbols, and white spaces, converting all tags to lowercase. Next, we vectorize the tags for each movie, considering only the top 500 most frequent tags to reduce computational load. These tags are used to construct a matrix.To find the closest movies, we compute the distance between any two movies, with the closest distance indicating the most similar movies. We employ cosine distance as the metric, as opposed to Euclidean distance, due to the 'curse of dimensionality.' In higher dimensions, Euclidean distance performs poorly as the space becomes vast and distances between points become evenly distributed, making it difficult to distinguish between them.In our app, we store previously viewed movies for each user. We pass the last 5 movies to the model and retrieve results in an array. Additionally, we take the top three cast members and directors from each previously viewed movie, finding their top movies and adding them to the result. We also query the TMDB API for similar movies to each previously viewed movie, appending the top match to the result. We then filter out duplicates from the final result array, considering genre and language preferences to sort the array. This entire process is facilitated through API requests created with Flask

Immersive Movie Details Screen: Seamless Interaction and Comprehensive Information for Enhanced User Experience
The movie details screen of our app offers comprehensive insights, providing users with a thorough understanding of the movie in a visually appealing and user-friendly UI. Users can add or delete movies from their saved lists directly from this screen. A list icon button opens a modernized modal that dynamically adjusts its text, color, and label color based on whether the movie is already added to a list. A loading indicator inside the button provides feedback during addition and deletion processes. Movies can be added to favorite, watch list, or already watched list, each identified by a distinct icon such as a heart, clock, or bookmark, respectively. The screen features a 'Play Videos' button, directing users to a video screen containing movie-related content. Additionally, a share icon button opens a modal for easy sharing of the movie link via social media platforms or copying the link for sharing through other apps. The shared link directly opens the respective movie page. Our app also suggests similar movies related to the one being viewed. Furthermore, users can access cast details, featuring top casts for the movie. Clicking on a cast member takes users to a specific cast details screen containing the respective bio details. Additionally, users can submit ratings for the movie directly from this screen, enhancing the interactive experience.

Effortless List Management: Seamlessly Access and Organize Saved Movies with Offline Support and Intuitive Gestures
The list screen of our app serves as a hub for users' saved lists, including favorites, already watched, and watch list, all of which are locally stored for offline access. The screen features a top bar with three segmented buttons, each directing users to their respective saved movie lists. We've designed the interface to showcase movies in a carousel format with a parallax effect, enhancing the user experience with a visually appealing UI. When the device is online, selecting a movie from the list redirects users to the main movie details screen. However, if the device is offline, our app seamlessly switches to the offline movie details screen, which provides essential insights about the movie, albeit with slightly less detail. To ensure easy management of saved movies, users can delete a movie with a simple long-press gesture, triggering a modal for seamless deletion.

Sophisticated Chat Inte rface: Intuitive Messaging Experience with Offline Support and Rasa-Powered Chatbot Capabilities
Our chat screen boasts a modern and user-friendly UI, with the user's messages displayed on the right side and the chatbot's replies on the left side, distinguished by different avatar icons and bubble colors. Each message bubble also features a timestamp, allowing users to easily recall when a message was sent. All chat messages are available offline, stored securely in local storage. Powering our chatbot is Rasa, an open-source conversational AI framework that utilizes natural language understanding (NLU) to train chatbot models. Here's how it works: using examples, the model recognizes user intents, determining what the user wants to do. Once the intent is recognized, the model checks predefined 'stories' to determine the next steps, following a predefined conversational flow. API calls and data fetching are handled in 'actions' using Python. The model then outputs the result, establishing interaction between the client and the model via API calls. Our chatbot is capable of handling a wide range of questions, including those related to movie details such as director, overview, genres, rating, release date, runtime, budget, cast details, production companies, playback singers, writers, composers, choreographers, and editors, as well as questions about specific cast members.

Streamlined Settings Interface: Intuitive Navigation and Enhanced User Control with Second-Time Confirmation Modals
Our app features a modern and user-friendly settings screen where options are neatly categorized for easy navigation. For instance, under 'Profile Management,' users can update their profile or change their password. In 'App Preferences,' users can select themes, enable voice features, and manage push notifications. 'Data Management' offers options to clear search history, viewing history, delete all lists, and delete chats. Under 'Support,' users can access contact support, provide feedback, and report issues. Lastly, 'Account Management' allows users to sign out or deactivate their account. To enhance user experience, we've implemented a modal for second-time confirmation, minimizing accidental presses and ensuring user actions are deliberate.
